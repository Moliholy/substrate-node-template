//! # Trustless File Server Pallet
//!
//! The Trustless File Server pallet provides functionality to store and serve files
//! along with the cryptographic proofs using [merkle trees](https://brilliant.org/wiki/merkle-tree/).
//!
//! The idea is to store file contents on the blockchain and serve them in chunks, along
//! with the corresponding cryptographic proof. With that proof, the client is able to compute back
//! the merkle root of the file, hence proving the files obtained in the chunk are correct.
//!
//! This methodology is pretty similar to how the Bittorrent protocol works. More information
//! about this protocol can be found [here](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0030.html).
//!
//! This implementation has the following characteristics:
//! - It uses a fixed file chunk of 1KB
//! - The hashing algorithm is `sha256` instead of Bittorrent's original one: `sha1`.
//! - Files are stored on the blockchain. Bear in mind that this is an overall bad practice and
//! should be used with caution. A notable improvement to this pallet would actually be to
//! use IPFS or any other decentralized storage protocol to store files, and only keep on the
//! blockchain storage the associated hash.
